## Introduction

I started as a MUD player, then studied CS, became a Vim user, learned
JavaScript. I’m pretty sure I’m going to program until the end of my life.

I attended social movements since college and became a environmentalist since
the recent drought in Taiwan.

I live in Taiwan, have cats, listen to classical, read manga, watch movies and
anime, play SNES, DOS and Sims 4.
